The standard way to use neff on the client & the server side is to check for enabled features using the `isEnabled()` API.

```javascript
var users = 500;
var moreUsers = neff.isEnabled("moreUsers");
if (moreUsers) {
    users++;
}
```

### Server Side Usage

#### NConf-Based Config

To get started with neff you'll want to make sure you have setup nconf to contain a `features` setting, which is an object with feature names and either `true` or `false` values. I'm currently doing this using a JSON file and my config looks like this:

```json
"features": {
    "feature1": true,
    "feature2": false
}
```
#### Argument-Based Config

If you'd instead like to pass the features as parameters you can call the factory method to merge the arguments passed to the method with any (optional) nconf configuration you utilize in your project.

```
app.use(neff.factory({
    "feature1": true,
    "feature2": false
}));
```

#### Express Helpers

Neff provides a middleware to add feature flag information to express views. Its usage is:

```
app.use(neff.helpers);
```

The first thing it allows you to do is access feature flags directly in your template such as (dust syntax):

```
{?feature-feature1}
MY HIDDDEN CODE
{/feature-feature1}

```

It also provides a string of class names you can insert into your `<body>` (dust syntax):

```html
<body class="{featureClasses}">
```

The output prepends `feature-` to the classname, so you might see something like `<body class="feature-feature1">` with the config above. Only enabled features show up in the string.

#### Express Router Limiter


This route is only available when the feature flag is enabled. Otherwise the user would see a server error page.

```javascript
var neff = require("neff");
app.get("/myhidden/route", neff.limit("feature1"), function(req, res) {
   res.send("You have found feature1!");
});
```

### Client Side Usage


Make sure your features are declared on your DOM like so:

```
<body class="feature-feature1 feature-feature2">
```

Once you've done that you can take advantage of the flags in 2 ways.


#### CSS

```css
/* Create a block that's hidden by default */
.my-cool-block {
	display: none;
}

/* Display that block when your flag is present */
.feature-feature1 .my-cool-block {
	display: block;
}
```

#### JavaScript

```javascript
define(["neff"], function(neff) {
	if (neff.isEnabled("feature1")) {
		/* .. */
	}
});
```
